# Spike: AudioContext.setSinkId to VB-CABLE A

**Question:** Can an Electron renderer (Web Audio API, Chromium-based) route output to VB-CABLE A virtual playback device using `AudioContext.setSinkId`?

**Why it matters:** Our entire audio output path depends on this working. If it doesn't, we pivot to `naudiodon` (Node-PortAudio bindings) for direct main-process playback.

## Setup

- VB-CABLE A+B installed (https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)
- Electron version: 42.x
- Spike script: `scripts/spike-setSinkId.ts`

## Method

1. From `C:\dev\realtime-translate`, run:
   ```
   npm run spike
   ```
2. App opens with a dropdown listing output devices.
3. Select **CABLE-A Input (VB-Audio Cable A)**.
4. Click "Play 440 Hz tone".
5. To listen for the tone: open Windows Sound settings -> Recording tab -> right-click **CABLE-A Output** -> Properties -> Listen tab -> check "Listen to this device", choose your real headset, click OK. You should hear the tone for 1 second.

## Result

**Run date:** 2026-05-07
**Run by:** Gabriel
**Hardware/OS:** Windows 11, VB-CABLE basic (single cable, not A+B variant)

- [x] **PASS** — tone audible on CABLE Output via Windows monitoring
- [ ] FAIL

### Notes

- Tested with the basic VB-CABLE (single cable named "CABLE Input"/"CABLE Output"), not the A+B variant. The single cable was sufficient to validate that `AudioContext.setSinkId()` accepts a virtual cable's `deviceId` and routes audio through it.
- For full M1 (bidirectional), VB-CABLE A+B will need to be installed (donationware). The spike does not block on that — the Web Audio API behavior is identical for any virtual playback device.

### Issues encountered during spike scaffold (now fixed)

1. **`type: module` in root package.json** caused tsc's CommonJS output (`exports.X = ...`) to fail to load as ESM. **Fix:** wrapper script `scripts/run-spike.cjs` renames the compiled output to `.cjs` so Node forces CommonJS regardless of the parent `package.json`.
2. **`data:` URLs are not a secure context** in Electron, which strips `navigator.mediaDevices` (yielding `undefined`). **Fix:** spike now writes its HTML to a temp file and loads it via `loadFile()` for a proper `file://` origin.
3. **Default `setPermissionRequestHandler`** suppressed media permission. **Fix:** spike installs a handler that auto-grants `media` so device labels are populated without a popup.

## If FAIL

Pivot to `naudiodon`:
- `npm i naudiodon`
- Implement playback in main process via PortAudio bindings instead of Web Audio
- Update `src/offscreen/webAudioBridge.ts`: remove `setSinkId` path; either delegate playback to main via IPC or load native module via Electron sandbox-friendly path
- Update Tasks 12-14 plan accordingly

## M1 end-to-end smoke

**Run date:** 2026-05-07
**Run by:** Gabriel
**Hardware/OS:** Windows 11, VB-CABLE basic (single cable), Electron 42, USB headset

**Result:** ✅ **PASS**

**Procedure:** Per `docs/QA-CHECKLIST.md`. CABLE Output monitoring routed to real headset via `mmsys.cpl`. App opened to M1 Test Rig, API key encrypted via safeStorage, mic = USB headset, output = CABLE Input (auto-recommended after the basic-VB-CABLE detection fix). Clicked Start → status `idle → connecting → active`. Spoke Portuguese for ~10 seconds. Heard English translation through headset within ~2 seconds.

### Issues hit during smoke (now fixed in tree)

1. **Output dropdown didn't show CABLE Input.** `deviceDetector.ts` regex required A or B suffix; basic VB-CABLE has neither. Fix: added fallback `PLAIN_PLAYBACK`/`PLAIN_RECORDING` regexes that fill cableA slot when no A+B variant detected. Commit `8f4892b`.

2. **`Status: error — Unknown parameter: 'session.input_audio_format'`.** The `/v1/realtime/translations` endpoint does not accept `input_audio_format`/`output_audio_format` — those belong to the conversational `/v1/realtime` endpoint. Translation format is implicit PCM16 24kHz mono per OpenAI docs. Plan-level bug carried into Task 9. Fix: removed both from `session.update` payload. Commit `c75a187`.

Both fixes have new tests in the suite.

## M2 end-to-end smoke (bidirectional)

**Run date:** 2026-05-08
**Run by:** Gabriel
**Hardware/OS:** Windows 11, VB-CABLE A+B installed (alongside basic VB-CABLE from M1), Electron 42, USB headset, Google Meet on PC + Google Meet on phone as remote participant

**Result:** ✅ **PASS**

**Procedure:** Per `docs/QA-CHECKLIST.md` M2 section. Both directions transitioned `idle → connecting → active`. PT spoken on PC headset → phone (Meet remote) heard EN translation. EN spoken on phone → PC headset heard PT translation.

### Issue hit during smoke (now documented in QA-CHECKLIST)

- **Initial latency was ~30 seconds** because the M1-style "Listen to this device" monitoring was still enabled on `CABLE-A Output` (and would have been on `CABLE-B Output` similarly). The monitoring replicates the EN translation through the user's headset, the headset mic captures it, the app re-queues it for translation, and `pendingAudio` accumulates a backlog. **Fix:** disable Listen-to-this-device on both cable Outputs for M2 (M2 doesn't need the M1 debugging affordance — Direction B's translation plays directly to the user's headset via `setSinkId`). After disabling, latency returned to the expected 1-3s.
- QA-CHECKLIST.md updated with a prominent warning so the next person doesn't repeat this.

## M3 end-to-end smoke (FloatingWidget UI + first-launch routing)

**Run date:** 2026-05-08
**Run by:** Gabriel
**Hardware/OS:** Windows 11, VB-CABLE A+B installed, Electron 42, USB headset, Google Meet on PC + Google Meet on second device as remote participant

**Result:** ✅ **PASS**

**Procedure:** Per `docs/QA-CHECKLIST.md` M3 section. First-launch flow correctly opened SetupView with no bar; saving API key + selecting 4 devices + clicking "Concluir setup" spawned the FloatingWidget and closed the SetupView. Subsequent launch went straight to the bar. PT spoken via PC mic translated to EN at the second device (Direction A). EN spoken at the second device translated to PT in the PC headset (Direction B).

### Issue hit during smoke (Meet config gotcha — not a regression)

- **Direction B initially passed EN through untranslated.** Cause: Meet's PC speaker was set to "FxSound Speakers" (system default) instead of `CABLE-B Input`. Meet played the EN audio straight to the headset, bypassing the cable; Session B captured silence from `CABLE-B Output` and emitted no deltas. **Fix:** in Meet → Settings → Audio → Speaker, pick `CABLE-B Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable B)` (NOT the `CABLE-B In 16ch` multi-channel variant). After the change, Direction B worked as expected.
- This is an instance of the broader "VB-CABLE setup is hard for non-technical users" concern. The next milestone (real SetupView with detection + screenshots + Test Translation) will mitigate by walking the user through Meet config visually and validating the pipeline without requiring a live Meet session.
